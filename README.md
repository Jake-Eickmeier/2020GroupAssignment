# 2020GroupAssignment
CSCI 2020U Final group project

## Group members:
Jake Eickmeier, Connor Robertson, Raphael Nation, Hayden Murray

**Project link**: https://github.com/Jake-Eickmeier/2020GroupAssignment

## **Instructions for running application:**
In a command prompt in the project directory, do:
```
gradle build
gradle run
```
Once the application is run, you'll arrive at the main menu.
Use the 'down' arrow key to cycle through the options. By pressing 'enter' on a menu option,
you can access that menu item. First, it is recommended to go into customization and click through
the options to customize your avatar. Type in a username and be sure to press save! Afterwards,
by entering chat from the main menu you can start a server. This will open up a chat room on the local network.

To converse with another client, run another instance of the program in a different command prompt. Proceed
similarly to the above instructions and create a username, but this time join a chat instead of creating one!
You will now be able to freely talk between each other :).
